        <div class="prose">
        <p>It was a cold January day when Tim and Jo matched on Coffee Meets Bagel, a dating app. Tim asked Jo about growing a balcony garden; Jo asked Tim about his Amtrak travel (for everyone who's heard this story before, we'd forgotten about the sequence until we checked the chat for this story!). After connecting over their appreciation for Amtrak travel, Jo asked Tim to coffee.

        <p>They met at Collectivo, a cute coffee shop in Lincoln Park. Jo's first impression of Tim was, "Wow, look at that tall man." Tim's first impression of Jo was that she was sweet and a great conversationalist. They walked away from that experience open to meeting for a second time. And a third time. And a fourth time...

        <p>Over the next several weeks, Tim and Jo explored Chicago. They enjoyed each other's company over pizza, french fries, and of course, ice cream. They had many long conversations, often during long walks around the city.

        <p>Tim asked Jo if she wanted to be a couple in February—she responded by asking for more time. In March, Jo answered by taking Tim on a photographic scavenger hunt around the city that ended with her asking him to be her person. He said yes!

        <p>What followed next was a whirlwind of adventures. They met each other's families and friends, traveled from coast to coast (like a tour—The Tim and Jo Tour of 2022), and continued learning about each other's values, goals, and needs. Jo fancied Tim's thoughtful and prepared approach to life, while Tim admired Jo's creativity and consciencious demeanor.

        <p>Together, they've danced salsa, grown beets from a balcony, and riden tadem bicycles (for a more detailed account of their adventures, see Tim's newsletter). They began to dream of a future where they continue to learn together.

        <p>Tim asked Jo to marry him on a beautiful sunny day in January. She said yes! And now, they're preparing for the part of their story where they get to celebrate their love with friends and family.

        <h2>When</h2>

        <p>Be in a seat by 4:30 pm.</p>

        <h2>About the ceremony</h2>

        <p>Jo and Tim are getting married in a bilingual self-uniting (Quaker)
        ceremony. This tradition does not involve an officiant. After a moment
        of silent reflection, Jo and Tim recite their vows to each other. Then,
        friends and family are invited to take turns sharing a message of love
        and support with the couple. Once the message sharing is complete,
        everyone signs the marriage certificate.</p>

        <p>After about 45 minutes, those who have more messages to share can
        leave a message in our audio guestbook phonebooth.</p>

        <p>How to prepare:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/18YfqzHGTp4">What to expect at
            a Quaker wedding</a>.</li>
            <li>Read about the <a
            href="https://ilym.org/ilym/marriage/">marriage process according
            to the Illinois Yearly Meeting</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Guests of all ages are welcome to participate&mdash;we would be
        thrilled for your little ones to share their thoughts!</p>
